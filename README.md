# MNIST

MNIST is a large dataset of handwritten digits from 0 to 9. It contains 60000 images of size (28 * 28)in training data and 10000 images of same size in test data. I have used tensorflow and keras and tensorflow frameworks to understand the basic deep learning application of classification.
